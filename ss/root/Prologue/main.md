# Checks
### The most important mechanic in this TRPG.
When you need to decide a certain event's success or failure, you will do a **Check**. Not all dice rolls are checks, but all checks are dice rolls.

1. **DP** (Dice Pool) is often built by __Main stats + Sub stats + Adjustments__.
2. **AS** (Additional Success) exists when you are REALLY professional at certain thing - They are numbers that get added up after rolling your DP. **AS only applies if you roll at least 1 success**
3. **DC** (Difficulty Class) is a certain number indicating the least amount of success you need to complete something.
Now, you can roll your dice with the following command: ***.(DP)wd+(AS)***


Example:

```
CH: I want to have a battle with this NPC in... Chess.
GM: Roll INT+Crafts (Chess)
CH: //INT 4 + Crafts (No Profession) 2/2 = 5
*CH uses command .5wd, gets 2 Success*
GM: *Hidden rolls for NPC, with DC2* You won the match easily; it didn't even take more than 10 minutes.
```

4. There are generally two types of Checks.
- **Competing Checks** (C. Checks) are Checks with a determined DC by ST. 
*ex. Climbing a wall, Kicking a ball, Solving a Rubik's Cube... etc.*
- **Resisting Checks** (R. Checks) are Checks with a determined DC by another Roll Beforehand. The example in the above paragraph is a Resisting Check.
*ex. A Chess game with another character, tripping your enemy... etc.*

# Opportunity Roll (Opp. Roll)
Some things are solely determined by luck, like if you're going to meet a slime on your path to the town. In this case, roll a 1d10.

And, If you somehow got negative, or have 0DP to roll, You can do an Opp. Roll as well: __However, this roll only grants you 1 success if you get a 10, and rolling a 1 is a critical failure.__
**Opp. Roll is NOT a Check.**

## Using your AS
AS exists to make your possibly successful rolls even better! That means you have to be successful at a roll (Have at least 1 Success on DP) in order to add your AS on top of it.

## + Dice
Normally, By default you have "10+ Dice", which means if you roll a 10 you get to roll 1 extra dice. Sometimes you might get "9+ Dice" or "8+ Dice", which work the same way - you get the extra dice bonus when you roll greater or equal to your + Dice level.

## Mathematical Stuff
For cases where only whole numbers are used, numbers with floating point digits are rounded down.
