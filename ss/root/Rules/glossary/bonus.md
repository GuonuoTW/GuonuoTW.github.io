# Bonus & Penalty

**Bonus:**
Some Enhancements or Abilities may give you "Bonus" with a certain type. These bonuses grant you additional DP in some situations.

Unless specified, when multiple bonuses of the same type apply to a single aspect (Checks, Stats...), only the highest value applies. If it's from multiple different sources, they are added up together. 
Bonuses from the same source, with the same type may stack together as a whole.
