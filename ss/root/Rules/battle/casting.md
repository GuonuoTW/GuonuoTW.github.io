# Spellcasting

**NOTE: NOT ALL SPELLS ARE MAGIC.**

## Prologue: The concept of Magic
*You may skip this part.*






## **Caster Competency**
Resources that gives you a Caster Level is a single Caster Competency,
*ex: even if they both are called Arcane Magic, it's still 2 different Caster Competency.* 
Spells are NOT compatible across systems. When you learn a spell, it is only listed under the according Caster Competency. When you learn a Universal Spell, you need to choose which Caster Competency it is under.
*ex: Wizard and Sorcer both learn magic, but are different magic system. Thus has different Caster Competency.*

## **Compatibility Across Multiple Caster Competencies**
( WIP ) You may spend Tier*1XP to move one spell from one Caster Competency to another. This allow you to use Amplify or Research with the new Caster Competency. 

## **Caster Level**
Caster Level depends on the highest level of ability that provides you with spellcasting capability. 
Caster Levels are D1, C2, B3, A4, S5.
Some spells in the Resources depend on spell level. These spell levels generally have their own level descriptions. If not specified, then determine their level according to D1, C2, B3, A4, S5.

## **Advantage of Spells**

## **Components of Spells**
A spellâ€™s components explain what you must do or possess to cast the spell. It's different between spells, read the description of the spell to see what component it requires.
- Verbal (V): You need to have the ability to speak.
- Tome (T): You need the according tome flipped open in hand.
- Material (M): You need the required items on you.
- Somatic (S): You need to have the ability to pose.

*ex: If somehow you are silenced and can not speak, then you cant do any spell with Verbal component.*

## **Interrupting a Spell**

## **Target of a Spell**
If the description of the Spell Target explicitly contains Target, you must be able to Locate the targets - You can not cast the spell otherwise. Some spells affect an area instead, then you do not need to be able to Locate the target.
(See: [[Scout and Locate]])

## **Spell Power**
|Spell Level| Energy Pool Cost | Spell Power |
|---|---|---|
|D|1|2|
|C|3|4|
|B|5|6|
|A|7|10|
|S|9|16|


## **Spell Effect**
Some descriptions of the spell has an immediate effect, and it is, in fact, a real thing in the story! (Duh!) 
*ex: A spell that makes water would actually generate water in RP.*

## **Amplify and Research**
Some spells allow user to Amplify it. Some spells allow user to Research deeper into it, to make it a stronger spell. See the description of the spell for these.

## **Upgrading a Spell**
You can upgrade a spell by spending "Current level^2" XP, Unless Otherwise Specified. (D -> C -> B -> A -> S)
