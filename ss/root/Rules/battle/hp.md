# HP, Willpower, and Energy Pools

# HP 
Health Points (HP) represents a character's current health status. Each point of HP they have corresponds to one of 4 types of injuries: 

- Healthy (H)
- Blunt (B)
- Lethal (L)
- Aggravated (A)

(H+B+L+A=Total HP.)
This is indicated by HP(?), ? as the type of injuries.
B, L, A type of HP are collectively called "Wounded Points"
(ex. HP(H) means H type of HP.)

Every time your character take damage, check whether they "Faint" or "Deteriorate".

**Fainting** <br>
If the character no longer have any HP(H) and they do not have any HP(A), Your character faints. (Unconscious).

Your character wake up the moment they recovers a point of HP(H) or a point of Willpower.
The character can also be awakened by RP methods, including splashing cold water - ST decides whether it works or not.


**Deteriorating** <br>
If the character no longer have any HP(H) and they DO have HP(A), then other than fainting, they also suffer deterioration. At the end of the character's turn, a point of HP turns into HP(A) (HP(L) first). This continues until either the character only have HP(A) or they recovers a point of HP(H). In addition, deterioration stops the moment the character recovers HP from any source, or a successful "First Aid" Check. 

**Death** <br>
If the character only have HP(A), they are consider "Dead" unless specify. Some abilities might trigger on death, choose ONLY ONE to activate. (All other abilities remain untriggered.)

**Life states** <br>
Some enhancements or abilities allow you to know a creature's life states. Unless specified, rather than exact numbers, you will only get one of the following vague states:

- Unharmed: The creature isn't injured at all. (All HP(A))
- Minor injured: Convert all the wounded points into HP(B) (L->2B, A->3B), and it does not exceed their total HP.
- Moderate injured: Convert all the wounded points into HP(B) (L->2B, A->3B), and it exceeds their total HP, but less than double their total HP.
- Severe injured: Convert all the wounded points into HP(B) (L->2B, A->3B), and it exceeds double their total HP.
- Near death: The creature only have HP(A), but is not dead for reasons.
- Dead: The creature is dead.

**Taking Damage** <br>
Likewise, Damages are also split into DMG(B), DMG(L), DMG(A).


When you take DMG(B), for every point of DMG, turn 1 HP(H) into 1 HP(B); If you no longer have HP(H), turn 1 HP(B) into 1 HP(L); If you no longer have HP(B), turn 1 HP(L) into 1 HP(A) 

When you take DMG(L), for every point of DMG, turn 1 HP(H) into 1 HP(L); If you no longer have HP(H), turn 1 HP(B) into 1 HP(L); If you no longer have HP(B), turn 1 HP(L) into 1 HP(A) 

When you take DMG(A), for every point of DMG, turn 1 HP(H) into 1 HP(A); If you no longer have HP(H), turn 1 HP(B) into 1 HP(A); If you no longer have HP(B), turn 1 HP(L) into 1 HP(A) 
If you take multiple degrees of DMG, start converting from the lowest tier (B then L then A)
