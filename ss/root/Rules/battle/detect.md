# Scout and Locate
**Locating:** Knowing where the enemies are.
**Scouting:** Knowing that there are enemies.

1. All methods of scouting has its own "Scout Tier" and "Anti-Scout Tier", which is the Tier of the method.
2. All methods of scouting are split into one of the four categories: Natural, Tech, Fantasy, Eldritch. When two sides have different category, Scout side's Tier are considered one more tier higer.
3. If a "method of scouting" does not give you a way to locate the enemies, then the rules here also does not let you locate the enemies. 

Note: Human eyeballs is considerd Natural No Tier Scout Ability.

## Scout and Anti-Scout Resisting

**Step 1. Check the abilities on the anti-scout side**
An "Anti-Scout" ability give you ability to make the "Scout" side not able to detect you - A easier way to understand it is that the ability makes you invisible.
The ability is called the "Method of Anti-Scouting".
If the Anti-Scout side does not have a method of anti-scouting, then ignore all of the rules below: All characters are seen in another character's vision.
Otherwise, go to step 2.

**Step 2. Check the abilities on the scout side**
Compare all Scout abilities with Anti-Scout abilities.
If the Scout side's ability is higher tier than Anti-scout side's, Anti-scout side is Precisely Located.
If the Scout side's ability is equal tier to Anti-scout side's, Anti-scout side is Roughly Located.
If the Scout side's ability is lower tier to Anti-scout side's, Scout side is unable to locate Anti-scout side.

If the Scout side does not Precisely Locate the Anti-scout side, Go to next step.

**Step 3. Both side resists**
On each turn, Scout side performs PCT + Investigation (Scouting) Check, Anti-scout side resists with AGI + Stealth(Hiding) Check.
If the Scout side wins, the Scout side can Precisely Locate the Anti-scout side if they were able to Roughly Locate the Anti-scout side; the Scout side can Roughly Locate the Anti-scout side if they were unable to locate the Anti-scout side.

The following bonuses/penalties may take into effect and stack into the resisting:

If the Anti-scout side cannot be located, they are considered "invisible". All Stealth skill related Checks gain +10DP Environment Bonus.
If it's noisy, the Scout side suffers -2DP Environment Penalty.
If the Anti-scout side has attacked, talked, casted a spell, moved past half of their speed, or anything similar, the Scout side gains +2DP Enviroment Bonus for each.
If the Anti-scout side is in Scout side's Range of Sense, the Scout side gains +1DP Enviroment Bonus.
If the Anti-scout side is in Scout side's Rough Range of Sense, the Scout side gains +1DP Enviroment Bonus.


## Locating

There are two types of locating: Precise Locating and Rough Locating.

**Precise Locating:** You know EXACTLY where the target is. To humans, being able to see the target clearly is Precise Locating. 
You may attack the target without any penalty.
You may use any spell with "Choose X targets / Choose X targets in range".
You can tell exactly where the enemy is (Ex: 5m in front of me.)

**Rough Locating:** You know ROUGHLY where the target is. To humans, being able to hear the sound of a target but not seeing it is Rough Locating.
You may attack the target, but all success, AS, Status Points are halved.
You may attack the target with a spell, but with half the chance successing.
(EXCEPT spells with "Range" or "Within Range", those come into effect as usual.)

**Unable to Locate:** You do not know where the target is. To humans, the means you cant see or hear the enemies. You may assume where the target is and attack. If the target is at that place, then it is considered a Rough Locating. However, you may not choose them as a target of your spell. (EXCEPT spells with "Range" or "Within Range", those come into effect as usual.)

Without otherwise specify, Humans may only Precise Locate with eyesights.
Blind people may not locate a target with eyesights. Deaf people may not locate a target with hearings.
