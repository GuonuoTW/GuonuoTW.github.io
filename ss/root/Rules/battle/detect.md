# Scout and Locate
**Locating:** Knowing where the enemies are.
**Scouting:** Knowing that there are enemies.

1. All methods of scouting has its own "Scout Tier" and "Anti-Scout Tier", which is the Tier of the method.
2. All methods of scouting are split into one of the four categories: Natural, Tech, Fantasy, Eldritch. When two sides have different category, Scout side's Tier are considered one more tier higer.
3. If a "method of scouting" does not give you a way to locate the enemies, then the rules here also does not let you locate the enemies. 

## Scout and Anti-Scout Resisting

**Step 1. Check the abilities on the anti-scout side**
A "Anti-Scout" ability give you ability to make the "Scout" side not able to detect you - A easier way to understand it is that the ability makes you invisible.
The ability is called the "Method of Anti-Scouting".
If the Anti-Scout side does not have a method of anti-scouting, then ignore all of the rules below: All characters are seen in another character's vision.
Otherwise, go to step 2.

**Step 2. Check the abilities on the scout side**


**Step 3. Both side resists**

## Locating

There are two types of locating: Precise Locating and Rough Locating.

**Precise Locating:** You know EXACTLY where the target is. Generally, being able to see the target clearly is Precise Locating. 
You may attack the target without any penalty.
You may use any spell with "Choose X targets / Choose X targets in range".
You can tell exactly where the enemy is (Ex: 5m in front of me.)

**Rough Locating:** You know ROUGHLY where the target is. Generally, able to hear the sound of a target but not seeing it is Rough Locating.
You may attack the target, but all success, AS, Status Points are halved.
You may attack the target with a spell, but with half the chance successing.
(EXCEPT spells with "Range" or "Within Range", those come into effect as usual.)
