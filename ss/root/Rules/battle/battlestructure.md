# How a battle goes

**Structure of a battle:**

* Start of the battle

* Surprise Round

(Everyone roll initiative and order accordingly.)

* Start of a round

(Everyone takes action in order.)

* End of a round



**Start of the battle**
This is trigger through GM's announcement. 

**Surprise Round / Assualt Round**
You may perform 1 Standard Action/Swift Action/Movement Action, and unlimited amount of Free Actions. Enemies who aren't in Surprise Round would be in No Tier Surprised status.
<u>Special Rule:</u> Despite being a Full-Turn Action, you may do a Charging Attack.

**Initiative in Surprise Round**
Everyone in Surprise Round rolls initiative to decide who goes first.

# Battle Begins!
**Initiative!**
Everyone who has not roll initiative does it. This is done by rolling a 1d10+( Character's Initative). This is NOT a check.

**It's My turn!**
The action economy in Space Shard goes like this:
On your turn, you get 1 of each action of the following: a Swift Action, a Movement Action, a Standard Action, and Unlimited amount of Free Action. There are more actions than these, see [[Concept of Time & Actions]] for more info.

Downgrading an action:
You may downgrade actions to have more of another action. (Whole-Round Actions > Full-turn Actions > Standard Actions > Movement Action > Swift Action)
*ex. You may downgrade your standard action to have 2 movement actions and a swift action.*

**Free Actions Examples**
Speaking, pulling a gun bolt, cocking a hammer, etc., are free actions unless they have special usage.
Pushing or kicking away effortless obstacles while moving (such as an empty cardboard box blocking the path) is a Free Action. Something that appears as though it could be kicked away but is actually very heavy might cause injury to the character (for example, kicking an empty cardboard box with hidden metal block inside.)

**Swift Actions Examples**
Pulling the bolt of a bolt-action rifle, or similar actions. Taking out a small item stored in an easily accessible place, for example, a test tube inserted in the front chest pocket of a shirt, or drawing a dart from a dart pouch.

**Movement Actions Examples**
Perform one movement. The distance can be up to your Speed.
Control a vehicle or ride a mount under normal conditions.
Jump or climb a distance. Depending on the situation, short jumps and climbing low heights can be part of a single movement. This also includes some elaborated stunts, such as jumping to grab a chandelier to swing across a table.
Draw a weapon from its sheath. Take down a bow worn on your back. Take items from a pocket.
Change the magazine of an automatic pistol. Load a bullet into a single-shot rifle. Use a speed loader for a revolver. Load an arrow into a light crossbow. String a light crossbow.
Open a closed door.
Take a sip of water (or other liquid). Eat a bite of easily chewable food or a small amount of medicine.
Pick up an item.
Guard. (See Below)

**Standard Actions Examples**
Perform a Melee or ranged attack, including bare-handed, weapons, throwing, archery, shooting, etc., are all Standard Actions.
Take out an item from a pouch.
Cast spells or use special abilities, unless specified, are standard actions.
Put away a weapon. (This refers to properly storing a weapon. Releasing your hands and letting the weapon drop to the ground is a free action)

For more types of actions and their details, see [[Concept of Time & Actions]] 

## Common actions in battles
Most resources would classify an ability as Melee or Ranged. (Melee here means a close-range attack, not necessarily with a weapon)
If the resource did not specify, Effects described as melee/ranged are classified as melee/ranged attacks. Unless specified, they default to using "reach"/"range" and other melee-related abilities.
Effects with no description specified are classified as neither melee attacks nor ranged attacks. The range, shooting distance, reach, etc. of such resources will be separately defined within the resource.

**Attack Check**
Any abilities with the word "Attack" in the description are considered an attack.
If the target is singular ("Target: Single") then Target Defense needs to be deducted. If no target is specified and instead affects all units in an area, defense is not deducted.
Additionally: a specified "STR + Blade" Check doesn't need to deduct defense.

**Area Effect**
Attacking each target in an area separately is not considered an AOE.
When attacking targets in an area separately, you must make a separate attack check against each target. When using similar abilities, you can still only attack targets you have already Located. (See [[Detect & Locate]])

**Multiple Effects**
For weapons with multiple special effects, when causing damage only once under normal circumstances, all multiple special effects can take effect.
When damage is caused by multiple ammunition with different effects or similar situations, if even one piece of ammunition among the multiple pieces has no special effect, then this damage has no special effects whatsoever. If each piece has a special effect, and they are all different, then the ST chooses one to take effect.

**Max DMG**
Any resource with wording "Extra DMG" is not taken into account of Max DMG

**DMG Exceeds/Overflow**
When a character receives damage exceeding what their current HP can take, the excess damage is not calculated, but the exceeding situation is noted.
*ex: A character has 2 HP(H) remaining and takes 5 DMG(L). When calculating health points, the character now has 2 HP(A), without calculating the 1 point of overflow damage, but the overflow damage situation is confirmed.
In some cases where resources have special instructions, overflow damage will be calculated.

Here are the types of attacks you may deliver.
Each success from the attack causes 1 point of damage.
### **<u>Melee Attacks</u>**
Base "Reach" : Born Weapon Size/2 (minimum 1) + Blade Weapon Size/3

**Barehand Attack:** Make a melee ordinary physical attack with your Born Weapon. (Most of the Born Weapon is your fists.)
This is a Standard Action.
Roll DP = STR + Brawl Skill + Born Weapon Damage - Target Defense ± Modifiers.
Max DMG = STR + Brawl + Born Weapon Damage.
Ordinary human bodies can only cause DMG(B); Learning specific abilities, and gaining special enhancements, using knuckles, or possessing other Born Weapons may cause DMG(L). 
Size of your Fist, Feat, Claws is your Size/5.
Size of your tail is your Size/3.

**Bladed Attack:** Make a melee ordinary physical attack with blades.
This is a Standard Action.
Roll DP = STR + Blade Skill + Blade Weapon Damage - Target Defense ± Modifiers, each success causing 1 point of damage.
Max DMG = STR + Blade Skill + Blade Weapon Damage.
Most Blades cause DMG(L), with some exceptions like sandbags, which causes DMG(B);
Most weapons have a requirement to use, generally Stats, Skills, or Professions.
If it's Stats or Skills, each point below the required value is "-2DP Machinary Bonus", up to 3 points below. In that case, you may not use the weapon
If it's Profession, see [[No Profession Penalty]].

**Full-Force Attack:** Does higher damage at the cost of your defense.
This is a Standard Action, and can only be performed once per round.
For this attack, you gain "Reinforcement Bonus" equal to your STR/2, capped at your Base Defense Value.
Afterward, you lose an equal amount of Base Defense for 1 round.

**Charge Attack:**
This is a Full-Turn Action, You spend a Movement Action to move in front of the enemy, then do a Melee Attack.
Calculate the distance you moved to reach the enemy: for every meter, you gain "+1DP Enhancement Bonus" to your attack roll, and your Base Defense loses 1 point.
This bonus may not exceed your Strength, nor can it decrease your Base Defense below 0. Your Speed limits how far you can charge.
When Charging, you must have a straight, clean path towards your enemy. Which means:
- You need to be able to move to the closest place where you can deliver your attack, and this place is not blocked or has any obstacle (沒有困難地形)
- There is no other Characters, Enemies, Crates, Terrain that hinders your movement.

特殊：若角色擁有某些特殊能力可以讓你沖鋒只受到力量上限的影響，則此時你可以無視基礎防御的上限，超過基礎防御的部分變為無名防御減值。
特殊：若角色擁有某些特殊能力可以讓角色不受到沖鋒減值，則此時角色進行沖鋒的最大DP上限，除非特殊說明，否則依然受到基礎防御和力量的影響。

### **<u>Ranged Attacks</u>**
Note: If you do not have Line of Sight or the target is hidden, you cannot attack even if they are in your range.

Distance Penalty: For every 1x the weapon's range unit that the target's distance exceeds, the Attack Check suffers a -2 DP penalty. Your maximum throwing attack distance is 1x range unit * STR: you might be able to throw farther, but cannot make a meaningful attack.

**Throwing weapon:** Make a ranged ordinary physical attack with a throwing weapon
This is a Standard Action.
Roll DP (Light Throwing Weapon or Throwing weapon)= DEX + Athletics + Weapon DMG - Target Defense - Distance Penalty ± Modifiers. 
Roll DP (Heavy Throwing Weapon)= STR + Athletics + Weapon DMG - Target Defense - Distance Penalty ± Modifiers. 
Max DMG = STR + Athletics + Weapon Damage.
If you don't meet the minimum STR requirement for using the weapon, for each point your below your STR, you suffer a "-2 DP Machinary Penalty" on attacks. If lower by 3 points or more, you cannot use it. 
Additionally, for each multiple of the weapon's range exceeded, you suffer an extra -2 DP Distance penalty.

**Bow:** Make a ranged ordinary physical attack with a bow.
This is a Standard Action.
Roll DP = DEX + Athletics + Weapon DMG - Target Defense - Distance penalty ± Modifiers.
The maximum distance for a bow attack is 8 times the bow's range unit.
Max DMG = Weapon DMG*2 + Athletics + Bow's STR requirement.
Bows must be used with two hands; you cannot use a bow with one hand.

**Gun / Crossbow:** Make a ranged ordinary physical attack with a gun or crossbow.
Note: "Cannons" do not fit under this category.
This is a Standard Action.
Roll DP = DEX + Firearms + Weapon DMG - Target Defense - Distance penalty ± Modifiers.
The maximum distance for a gun/crossbow attack is 5 times the gun/crossbow's range unit.
Max DMG = Weapon DMG*2 + Firearms.
These weapons gets "High Speed" Inscription on their attacks. (See Glossary/"Item Inscriptions")
If the target being shot at is within 5 meters, they can ignore the "High Speed" Inscription.

**Cannons:**
WIP

**Spellcasting:**
This is generally a Standard Action, but may vary depends on the description of the spell.
Roll DP = INT + Occult + Spell Power ± Modifiers.
The spell will determine whether it is an "attack" spell based on its own spell description. If its effect includes attack specifications, then the target's defense must be deducted as normal; otherwise, no deduction is needed.
When using spells that cause damage, debuffs, and spells that take account of your success count, the maximum number of successes after the check (including Max DMG and debuff points, etc.) = INT + Occult + Spell Power.
See "Casting a Spell" for more info.
A pure Spellcasting Check is not an attack, so actions that can be performed when attacked are ineffective.
However, actions that can be performed when taking damage can be used normally.
Spellcasting checks cannot receive bonuses like "you gain xx bonus when making an attack.", but Attack with an Spellcasting Check can receive such bonus normally.

**Aiming:** 
This is a Whole-round action.
You can only aim at enemies within a maximum of 3 range units and within your Blurry Vision Range. No checks are needed, 
When you attack your aimmed enemy, you gain +1DP Aiming Bonus and 1 point higher on Max DMG. If you do any other Standard Action or Movement Action before attacking, or if you are hit by a melee attack, you lose your aiming benefit.
You may Aim for multiple rounds up to 5 times.

### **<u>Defensive Actions</u>**

**Full Defense**
This is a Standard Action.
You focus on dodging your enemy. your Defense gains a Evade Bonus equal to your Basic Defense. At the same time, you gain DP Evade bonus equal to your Basic Defense on Saving Throws against area damage.
Additionally, If you can see your enemy with a gun/crossbow, their "High Speed" Inscription would be removed.
To keep this effect you need Focusing (See "Concept of Time & Actions")

**Guarding with Brawl**
This is a Movement Action.
Until your next turn, your defense gain Guarding Bonus equal to your Brawl skill.
If your born weapon has "Guarding" Inscription, you may add its size on Guarding Bonus. This is called Shielding.

**Guarding with Blade**
This is a Movement Action.
Until your next turn, your defense gain Guarding Bonus equal to your Blade skill. You must have blade weapons to guard with this action.
If your weapon has "Guarding" Inscription, you may add its size on Guarding Bonus. This is called Shielding.

**Finding Cover**
You can move behind pillars, trees, etc. to hide front attacks, especially Range attacks.
When attacked, draw a line between the attacker and the victim. If there's any obstacles, it's considered Covered. You are in "Covered defense" equal to (Covering object size - your size + 4) with maximum of 8. If the size of covering object is twice your size, you are considered "Fully Covered".

Different objects provides different amount of coverage. 
| Amount of coverage | Point | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Light cover | +2 Covering Defense | Behind a chair |
| Half cover | +4 Covering Defense | Peaking from a pillar with half of your body|
| Heavy cover | +8 Covering Defense | Crouch behind a car |
| Full cover | Enemies can not attack you since they can't Locate you. | In other rooms |

特殊：你使用帶有【格擋】的物品進行的并非掩蔽而是格擋，此時獲得的是格擋防御和盾牌防御，而非掩蔽防御。

特殊：當目標擁有繞過完全掩蔽定位你和攻擊你的能力，則不視為你全掩蔽。如范圍攻擊，或者雷達定位配合【貫穿】攻擊，在擊破你的掩蔽物后會對你造成傷害。

特殊：云霧，煙霧等可以穿過的掩蔽物只是由于遮蔽視覺對你造成掩蔽效果，所以除了全掩蔽之外，其不會造成其他掩蔽效果。

全掩蔽一般情況下會同時讓目標不知道你的具體位置。但是由于掩蔽物范圍的存在，敵人依然可以大致了解你的活動范圍。

若是通過云層，煙霧等可以穿過的效果造成的視覺的全掩蔽效果。若目標具備某些看穿云霧的效果（如盲視）則可以正常攻擊和定位。或者目標可以進行嘗試攻擊其自認為你所在的區域，如果正好你在，那么其視為在模糊定位下對你造成影響。

**Fire from Concealment / Attack behind a cover**: You may do Range Attacks behind a cover, with a penalty.
| Coverage | Penalty|
|---|---|
| Light Cover | -1DP Environment Penalty |
| Half Cover | -2DP Environment Penalty |
| Heavy Cover | -4DP Environment Penalty |
| Full Cover | No attack allowed! |
