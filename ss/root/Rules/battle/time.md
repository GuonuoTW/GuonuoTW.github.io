# Concept of Time & Actions

## Real Time Standards
Any description with real time units are counted in real, Reality units (Duh!)
*ex: If an effect last for 1 day, it's always 24 hours, even if the planet you are on is 48 hours a day.*

## Abstract Time Standards
Abstract times are Rounds, Scenes, Turns, etc.

**Rounds**
Used in battles.
After everyone in the battle takes an action is called a turn.
A turn is about 6 seconds in real time. 

**Turns**
Used in battles.
Everyone in the battle have their own "Turn", which means from the start of their action until the next start of their action. "For a turn" means start from your action until your next start of action.

**Scene / Encounter**
Scenes are mostly arbitrarily chosen by ST, Most common usage is: entering and exiting a battles are Change of Scenes, or an eyecatch/cutscene is a Change of Scene.

## Battle Time Standards
Battle time standards are only used in battles.
below are 6 different Battle Actions you gain on your turn.

**Free Actions**
There isn't a limit on how many Free Actions you can do, but you may only do it once for each action. Generally all Free Actions are done in your turn, except talking.

*ex: dropping the weapon in your hand is a Free Action, but after you use a Movement Action to take out another one, you can not drop it again.*

**Swift Actions**
You may do 1 Swift Action per turn.

**Movement Actions**
You may do 1 Movement Action per turn. You can convert Movement Actions into Swift Actions.

**Standard Actions**
You may do 1 Standard Action per turn. You can convert Standard Actions into a Movement actions.

**Full-turn Actions**
Full-turn Actions are actions that spends a Movement Action and a Standard Action.

**Whole-round Actions**
Whole-round Actions are actions that spends a Swift Action, a Movement Action, and a Standard Action.

**A Special Case: Anytime, or Without Actions**
"Anytime" means you may do it at anytime, even on other's turn. There isn't a limit on how many of these actions you can do. Anytime comes from some abilities.


### Other than the actions above, here are some of the special actions.

**Reflex Actions**
Other than proning, you can't do Reflex Actions on your own by default. If you do a Reflex Action, you lost all your Swift Action next turn. Unless Specified, you may only do 1 Reflex Actions per turn. Reflex Actions CAN interrupt other actions. They must continue what they were doing after interruption, or it counts as an automatic fail. Losing your next Swift Action is not a requirement to do a Reflex Action, that means you may do multiple Reflex Actions under certain circumstances. 

（若行動者攻擊的目標使用直覺動作離開，攻擊仍需繼續進行，因為行動仍然可以做出，但若目標使用反射動作讓攻擊者陷入了不能行動的狀態，例如打死，則攻擊行動失敗）。用反射動作離開攻擊范圍時，則在應對此次攻擊時閃避防御（包括基本防御）x2，若攻擊為范圍攻擊并且允許躲避，那么用于抵消范圍傷害或者范圍效果的相關檢定結果中成功數x2。

**Prepare Actions**
Prepare Actions allow you to prolong a certain action. The duration of the delay must be between the end of your turn and the start of your next turn. You may spend a Standard Action to announce a Prepare Action.

*ex: When enemies attack me, I move back 10m.*

You may prepare Standard, Movement, Swift, or Free Action. Afterwards and before your next action, the prepared action may be triggered, and will be triggered before the announced prerequisite - You interrupt the prerequisite action. You spend your next announced Standard, Movement, Swift, or Free Action for this.


**Focusing**
Some actions require you to focus on it for a duration. This action is called "Focusing". Most of the actions that require you to focus has an activating step. After activation, by default the focus last for a turn. If you want to continue focusing, you may spend an action according to the resource.
If it's not written, activating step is a Reflex Action, with Focus being Swift Action. You can only "Focus" on one thing at a time.

## Downgrading
Standard Actions can be converted into Movement Actions, Movement Actions can be converted into Swift Actions.

## Single Action and Extended Action

**Single Action**
Single actions refer to those actions that determine their results through one Check. When a behavior is a single action, it means that this behavior can be completed with just one or a few steps, and usually cannot or does not need to be repeatedly worked on to deepen its perfection.
Single actions typically include but are not limited to the following: jumping over a pit, shooting a basketball, making an attack, Scouting, opening a door, etc.

**Extended Action**
Extended actions refer to actions that require multiple Checks, accumulating successes to complete. When a behavior is an extended action, it means that the behavior needs to be carried out repeatedly through multiple steps, perfecting the work through step-by-step deep processing.
Extended actions include but are not limited to the following: making something, completing a work, completing a ritual, performing, repairing something, or extricating oneself from a situation.

**Repeating Single Actions**
Some actions need repeating, but is not an Extended Action. Generally, this occurs when each step of this action matters.
*ex: Trying to climb up a wall with zombies pulling you down*
