# Stats
In this system there are 9 different stats. They each correspond to 3 branches of 3 categories.
| |Intesity|Flexibility|Durability|
|---|---|---|---|
|**PHYSICAL**| STR (Strength)| AGI (Agility) | EDR (Endurance) |
|**MENTAL**| INT (Intelligence) | PCT (Perception) | DTR (Determination) |
|**SOCIAL**|DMR (Demeanor)| CTR (Control) | CMT (Composure) |

All stats are default to 1. Then, distribute 3/2/1 points to the three attribute categories: Physical, Mental, and Social, then add those points to stats. Then, you have 3 points to add on any stats. Note that raising stats from 4 to 5 require 2 points.

*Ex: Person A first allocates 3 points to Physical, 2 points to Mental, and 1 point to Social. For Physical, he increases STR, AGI, and EDR to 2 each, spending 3 points. For Mental, he increases INT and PCT to 2 each, spending 2 points. For Social, he increases CMT to 2, spending 1 point. Feeling that being somewhat unbalanced doesn't look good, he distributes the remaining 3 points to DTR, CTR, and DMR, raising each to 2. As a result, all of his attributes are 2.*
