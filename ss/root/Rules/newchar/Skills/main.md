# Skills & Professions

*Example: Player sneak into the room, and pull out their pistol to shot.*
Player needs Stealth (Sneaking) and Firearms (Pistol) Skills for this task.

Skills represent what you know and learned. You do not born with any Skills known, so the lowest possible level is 0. Skills is "Sub-stats" of Stats, as they are more narrow and direct in their usage. However, not all of them required a Skill Check. Some activities are so trivial that you may already know how to do it by having tried it once or twice before.
*ex: Making a sandwich does not require a Skill Check. Cooking a Steak may or may not required one, depends on how perfect the Steak needs to be.*
