# Skills
Skills are basically "What your character can do".
Just like stats, Skills are separated into 3 different categories: Physical Skills, Mental Skills, and Social Skills.

**Physical Skills:** Athletics, Brawl, Drives, Firearms, Larceny, Stealth, Survival, Blade.
**Mental Skills:** Academics, Computer, Crafts**, Investigation, Medicine, Occult, Politics, Science.
**Social Skills:** Animal Ken, Empathy, Expression**, Intimidation, Socialize, Subterfuge.

**Crafts and Expression is not a skills, but a group of skill condensed together. Craft may have many subcategory like "Craft-Cooking" and "Craft-Smithing" Being completely different skills. Talk to ST for the Professions you want.

Each Skill are separated into many Profession as well, they represent a certain way of using that skill.
"Professions" are almost all freedom, but we list down some of the most common one in the [[Skills]] Page.

All stats are default to 0. Then, distribute 6/5/4 points to the three skill categories: Physical Skills, Mental Skills, and Social Skills, then add those points to Skills. Then, you have 5 points to add on any stats. Note that the maximum skill level at the start is 3.

Then, you may have 3 free Professions to write under any skill with at least 1 level.
