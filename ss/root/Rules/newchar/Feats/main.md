# Feats / Expertise
"A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides." (Excerpt from DND 5e)

To learn a feat, for every level you need to spend 3 XP to learn it. If a feat has more than 1 level, you need to learn each level individually, in order.

**Therefore, If a feat has level 1~5, then it costs 3+6+9+12+15=45XP to completely learn it.**

If a feat start with higher level than 1, you only spend the corresponding XP to acquire. 
ex. If a feat has level 2~3, then it costs 6+9=15XP to completely learn it.

If a feat has a requirement that's related to one of more stats, the level of the feat may not exceeds the lowest of all the required stats.
ex. "Die-hard" requires minimum DTM 3, EDR 3, if you only fit the requirement, then you can not have level 4/5 Die-hard feat.

For Combat Feats, you can not have its level higher than your "Special Identity" level + 1. These feats SHOULD fit your character's background.

Without any specifications, DP Bonus you get from Feats are Expertise Bonus.
