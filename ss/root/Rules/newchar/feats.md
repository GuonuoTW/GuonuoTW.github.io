# Feats / Expertises
Feats give characters special abilities and advantages in some actions.

You have 5 points to spend on Feats, you may exchange a level for each point. If there's multiple level in a Feat, you may spend a point for each level.
Ex. If a Feat has level 1~3, you may spend 3 points to get all the effect, 2 points to get level 2, or 1 point for 1 level.
Some Feats may only have higher level, you have to be able to spend that many points on it.
